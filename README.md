Kanban Board Project 
This project is a web-based Kanban board designed and developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually represents tasks through cards organized into columns, enabling users to manage work efficiently.

🔧 Technologies Used:
HTML: To create the structure and layout of the board.

CSS: To style the board, cards, and drag-and-drop UI elements.

JavaScript: To add interactivity—especially drag-and-drop functionality, task creation, and state changes.

⚙️ Working of the Kanban Board
👇 Key Features and Flow:
Columns Represent Workflow Stages:

To Do → In Progress → Done

These can be customized or extended (e.g., Review, Testing)

Task Cards:

Each task is displayed as a card with a title and (optionally) description, deadline, or priority.

Add New Tasks:

Users can create new cards via an input form or a "+" button.

Drag and Drop:

Tasks can be dragged from one column to another using JavaScript’s drag-and-drop API.

This simulates real-time progress of tasks in a visual manner.

Dynamic Updates:

No page reload is required—JavaScript handles the changes in the DOM.

Optional Enhancements:

LocalStorage to persist tasks

Delete/edit functionality

Color-coded priority levels
   📌 Project Objective
To create a user-friendly task management tool that helps individuals or teams:

Organize work visually

Track task progress easily

Improve productivity through a simplified UI
